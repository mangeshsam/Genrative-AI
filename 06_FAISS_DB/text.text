He actively contributes to both technical development and training delivery within the organization. His primary technical expertise lies in Python and SQL for data analysis, preprocessing, automation, and backend logic. He works extensively with machine learning and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and has experience building models using CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, and traditional supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
 His workflow typically includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation,
  optimization, and deployment. At Affordable AI Technology, Mangesh Sambare works as a Junior Data Scientist and Project Mentor,
   where he leads and supports multiple client-based and internal AI projects. His work includes NLP-based systems, time series forecasting models, 
   AI chatbots, data dashboards, and automation pipelines. 
   He plays a key role in mentoring interns and trainees by guiding them through Python programming, 
   SQL querying, machine learning concepts, deployment practices, and real-time project execution.
    He is directly involved in delivering internship programs that emphasize hands-on learning with live datasets and industry-style problem statements. The organization operates with a strong focus on practical skills, real client exposure, and career-oriented training, and its branch operations have expanded to locations such as Buttibori. Before this role, he worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Softronix Software Services Pvt. Ltd., where he gained industry experience in data extraction, automation, and reporting. During this internship, he automated large-scale e-commerce data scraping using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and ChromeDriver, significantly reducing manual data collection effort. He also designed a Flask-based data pipeline to handle automated data ingestion, preprocessing, and analysis. In addition, he developed Excel-based dashboards and reports to track business KPIs and product performance. Mangesh Sambare has completed several end-to-end machine learning and deep learning projects. He developed a fashion item classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, achieving approximately ninety-two percent accuracy through proper normalization, dropout regularization, and activation tuning. He built an LSTM-based sentiment analysis system for e-commerce reviews using thousands of labeled samples and achieved over ninety-two percent accuracy. This system was integrated into a Flask web application for real-time sentiment prediction. He also completed a Flipkart product feedback analysis project involving the scraping of more than five thousand product reviews and ratings, followed by sentiment analysis and insight generation. Additionally, he developed automated image dataset acquisition tools using web scraping to collect high-quality image datasets from dynamically loaded web pages. His technical skill set spans Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Time Series Forecasting, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning, ETL pipelines, Data Warehousing concepts, RESTful APIs, Flask-based backend systems, Power BI dashboards, Excel analytics, web scraping, automation, Git, GitHub, and Agile-style project workflows. He is comfortable working on both research-oriented prototypes and production-style applications. Apart from development work, Mangesh Sambare is deeply involved in teaching, mentoring, and content creation. He conducts structured training programs in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, NLP, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. His teaching approach emphasizes real-world examples, interview-oriented problem solving, and hands-on live projects. He regularly designs short-term courses such as Python Basics programs, Machine Learning bootcamps, and Data Science internship tracks that include training, project work, and career guidance. He runs a technical YouTube channel named “LearnCode_Mangesh” (also known as “LearnCode',
